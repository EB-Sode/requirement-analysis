# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository focuses on Requirement Analysis in Software Development, a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Its purpose is to demonstrate how to identify, document, and analyze user needs to ensure that the final software product meets business goals and stakeholder expectations. The repository includes examples, templates, and explanations that illustrate best practices for gathering, validating, and managing software requirements effectively.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the functional and non-functional needs or expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves close collaboration between developers, business analysts, clients, and end-users to ensure that the software being developed aligns with real-world needs and business objectives.

This phase forms the foundation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it sets the direction for all subsequent stages—design, implementation, testing, and deployment. A misunderstanding or omission during requirement analysis can lead to costly rework, project delays, or failure to meet user expectations.

Objectives of Requirement Analysis

Understand Stakeholder Needs: Capture what users expect from the system and translate those needs into clear, actionable requirements.

Define System Scope: Establish what the software will and will not do, preventing scope creep later in the project.

Facilitate Communication: Serve as a bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring mutual understanding.

Establish a Baseline for Development: Create a clear, agreed-upon reference point for developers, testers, and project managers.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Elicitation: Collect requirements through interviews, surveys, observation, brainstorming, and document analysis.

Requirement Documentation: Clearly record the gathered requirements using formats such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case diagrams.

Requirement Validation: Review and confirm that all documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible within constraints.

Requirement Management: Track, update, and manage changes to requirements throughout the project’s lifecycle.

Types of Requirements

Functional Requirements: Describe what the system should do (e.g., user authentication, data processing, report generation).

Non-Functional Requirements: Describe how the system should perform (e.g., performance, reliability, security, usability).

Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

Prevents Costly Errors: Detecting and resolving requirement issues early saves time, money, and effort compared to fixing them after development.

Improves Product Quality: A clear understanding of user needs ensures the final software delivers real value.

Enhances Stakeholder Satisfaction: Properly captured and validated requirements increase user trust and project success.

Enables Effective Planning: Provides a solid foundation for estimating time, cost, and resources needed for development.

Conclusion

Requirement Analysis is the cornerstone of successful software development. It ensures that every stakeholder’s expectations are well-understood, documented, and agreed upon before any coding begins. When done effectively, it minimizes misunderstandings, reduces risks, and leads to the delivery of high-quality, user-centered software solutions.


# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. Prevents Costly Rework and Project Failure

One of the most significant benefits of requirement analysis is that it helps identify potential issues early—before design and development begin. Mistakes or misunderstandings at this stage are much cheaper and easier to fix than those discovered later in testing or production.
By thoroughly analyzing requirements, teams can avoid building incorrect features or omitting essential ones, reducing the likelihood of project delays, budget overruns, and total project failure.

2. Ensures Alignment Between Stakeholders and Developers

Requirement analysis acts as a bridge between business stakeholders (who define what they need) and technical teams (who decide how to build it).
Through clear documentation, validation sessions, and continuous communication, all parties gain a shared understanding of project goals, scope, and expectations. This alignment ensures that the final product accurately reflects user needs and organizational objectives.

3. Provides a Clear Foundation for Design and Planning

Accurate and well-documented requirements serve as the blueprint for all subsequent phases—design, development, testing, and deployment.
They allow project managers to estimate timelines, costs, and resources more effectively. Developers and testers also rely on these requirements to create system designs, code modules, and test cases that align perfectly with desired functionalities and performance criteria.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering

This is the initial step in the requirement analysis process where the goal is to collect as much information as possible about the project from all stakeholders. It involves identifying who the stakeholders are (e.g., clients, users, managers, developers) and understanding their needs, goals, and expectations for the system.

Key Techniques:

Reviewing existing documents and business processes

Conducting stakeholder interviews or surveys

Studying current systems and workflows

Purpose:
To ensure no critical information is missed and that the project team has a solid foundation of data before moving to more detailed analysis.

2. Requirement Elicitation

Elicitation focuses on extracting the actual requirements from stakeholders through interactive communication and research. It’s not just about collecting what stakeholders say they want, but also uncovering what they truly need—including unstated or implicit expectations.

Common Elicitation Methods:

Brainstorming sessions

Questionnaires and workshops

Use case scenarios

Observation and shadowing of end-users

Prototyping and storyboarding

Purpose:
To bridge the gap between stakeholder expectations and technical feasibility, ensuring that real, practical requirements are identified.

3. Requirement Documentation

After gathering and eliciting information, all requirements must be clearly and formally documented. This documentation serves as a reference point throughout the SDLC.

Typical Formats:

Software Requirement Specification (SRS): A comprehensive document describing functional and non-functional requirements.

User Stories: Short, user-centered descriptions used in Agile methodologies.

Use Case Diagrams: Visual representations of user-system interactions.

Purpose:
To create an unambiguous, well-structured record of all requirements that developers, testers, and stakeholders can refer to during development and validation.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

In this phase, the documented requirements are analyzed, prioritized, and refined. The goal is to ensure they are feasible, consistent, and aligned with business objectives. Models and diagrams may be created to represent the system’s structure and behavior.

Common Techniques:

Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) – to show how data moves through the system

Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) – to model data relationships

Process Modeling – to map workflows and system processes

Prioritization – ranking requirements based on importance and impact

Purpose:
To transform raw requirements into structured, actionable insights that guide design and implementation, reducing ambiguity and risk.

5. Requirement Validation

Requirement validation ensures that the gathered and analyzed requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are technically achievable. This step verifies that each requirement contributes to business goals and that the documentation is complete and correct.

Common Validation Techniques:

Requirements review meetings with stakeholders

Prototyping or mockups for early feedback

Walkthroughs and inspections

Test case generation for requirement verification

Purpose:
To confirm that the final set of requirements is approved, realistic, and ready to guide development—preventing costly misunderstandings later in the SDLC.

### Conclusion

Together, these five activities form the backbone of effective requirement analysis. They ensure that software projects begin with a clear, validated understanding of what to build, how it should function, and why it’s important—laying the foundation for successful, high-quality software development.

# Types of Requirements

## Functional Requirements

Definition:
Functional requirements describe the specific features, behaviors, and functions that the system must perform. They define what the system should do to fulfill business objectives and user needs.

In the context of a Booking Management System, these requirements determine how users interact with the system to search, book, manage, and cancel reservations.

Examples:

The system must allow users to create an account and log in securely.

The system must enable customers to search for available rooms, flights, or services based on date, location, or preference.

The system must allow users to make new bookings and receive instant confirmation via email or SMS.

The system must enable administrators to view, update, or cancel customer bookings.

The system must generate and display booking receipts and payment summaries for each completed transaction.

The system must allow integration with multiple payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, or credit card).

The system must automatically update room or service availability after a successful booking.

Purpose:
To ensure that the software performs all core operations that meet user and business requirements effectively.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Definition:
Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform rather than what it should do. They define the quality attributes, constraints, and performance metrics that affect the system’s usability, scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

For the Booking Management System, these requirements ensure that the platform runs smoothly, remains secure, and delivers a satisfying experience for users.

Examples:

Performance: The system should be able to process at least 500 concurrent booking requests without performance degradation.

Availability: The system should maintain 99.9% uptime to ensure customers can book at any time.

Security: All user data and payment details must be encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols.

Usability: The user interface should be intuitive and responsive, allowing customers to complete a booking in under three steps.

Scalability: The system should support growth in traffic during peak booking seasons without requiring major infrastructure changes.

Maintainability: The system should allow updates and bug fixes to be deployed with minimal downtime.

Compatibility: The platform should function across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile devices.

Purpose:
To ensure that the system performs efficiently, securely, and reliably under various conditions—enhancing the overall user experience and business continuity.

### Summary

While functional requirements define the actions of the Booking Management System, non-functional requirements define the qualities of those actions. Together, they ensure that the system not only delivers essential booking functionalities but also meets the standards of performance, reliability, and user satisfaction required for long-term success.

# Use Case Diagrams
What is a Use Case Diagram?

A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and a system. It is part of Unified Modeling Language (UML) and is primarily used during the requirement analysis phase to capture and communicate the system’s functional requirements in a clear, high-level manner.

Each use case represents a distinct functionality or goal that an actor wants to achieve through the system, while the actors represent users or external entities that interact with it.

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

Clarifies System Boundaries: Clearly defines what functions are inside and outside the scope of the system.

Enhances Communication: Provides a simple visual tool that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand.

Aids in Requirement Validation: Helps ensure that all user interactions and goals are captured during the requirement phase.

Guides System Design: Acts as a blueprint for designing system components, workflows, and test cases.

Improves Traceability: Links functional requirements directly to user interactions and business goals.

# Acceptance Criteria
What is Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance Criteria (AC) are the predefined conditions or statements that a software product or feature must satisfy to be accepted by the user, client, or stakeholder. They serve as measurable benchmarks that define the boundaries of a user story or requirement, ensuring that all stakeholders share the same understanding of what “done” means.

Acceptance criteria are usually written in clear, testable language and guide both development and testing processes.

Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

Ensures Clarity and Shared Understanding
Acceptance criteria eliminate ambiguity by specifying exactly what is expected from a feature. Both developers and stakeholders understand what “successful completion” means.

Supports Test Case Development
Testers use acceptance criteria to design test cases and verify whether the developed feature meets all requirements. This ensures that testing aligns directly with business goals.

Guides Development Efforts
Developers use acceptance criteria as a checklist during implementation, ensuring that the code fulfills functional and non-functional expectations before delivery.

Facilitates Stakeholder Validation
Clients and product owners can validate the delivered product against acceptance criteria to determine if it meets the agreed-upon requirements.

Improves Quality and Reduces Rework
Clear, testable acceptance criteria prevent misunderstandings and help teams deliver exactly what users need—reducing costly changes later in the project.

Example: Acceptance Criteria for the “Checkout” Feature

Feature Description:
The Checkout feature allows users to finalize their booking by reviewing details, confirming payment, and receiving a booking confirmation.

Acceptance Criteria
ID	Condition / Criteria	Expected Outcome
AC-1	The user must be logged in to access the checkout page.	Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
AC-2	The checkout page must display booking details (date, location, service type, price) before payment.	All booking details are correctly displayed and editable before confirmation.
AC-3	The system must allow users to select a payment method (Credit Card, PayPal, or Wallet).	Payment options are displayed, and user can choose one.
AC-4	Upon successful payment, the system must generate a booking confirmation and display a success message.	User sees a “Booking Confirmed” message and booking reference number.
AC-5	The system must send a confirmation email or SMS to the user.	User receives notification immediately after successful checkout.
AC-6	If payment fails, the system must display an error message and allow the user to retry.	Payment failure is clearly communicated, and user can attempt payment again.
AC-7	Booking and payment details must be stored in the system database.	Data is successfully recorded and retrievable by both user and admin.
Summary

Acceptance Criteria are essential in Requirement Analysis because they bridge the gap between what stakeholders expect and what developers deliver. In the case of the Checkout feature, well-defined acceptance criteria ensure that all system behaviors—from payment processing to confirmation notifications—are tested, validated, and aligned with business needs.
